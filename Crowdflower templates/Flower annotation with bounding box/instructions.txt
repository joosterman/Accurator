				FLOWER definition: A FLOWER is considered to be the flowering part of a plant with petals and distinguishable from leaves. A branch can have multiple FLOWERS (but each of those flowers has the same NAME). A flower bud counts as a flower.
			</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>FLOWER NAMES: All flowers have a botanical name such as <i>Helianthus</i>. For most flowers there also exists an English common name such as <i>Sunflower</i>. You can provide either although we prefer the botanical name.</strong></p>
